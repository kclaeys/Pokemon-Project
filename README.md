# Pokemon
Javascript-based Pokemon game for fun and practice using various js libraries (jQuery, Underscore, Backbone, Marionette, and Grunt).
I intend to develop this solely for fun and practice, and do not intend to market or publish this in any way. If the time comes that I wish to pursue making this publicly available, I will investigate potential licensing and copyright issues.

Goal for v1.0.0
  - Have a very manageable world size/complexity:
    - 1 city made up of a few regions
    - 1 building
    - ~15 pokemon
    - ~3 NPCs
    - ~5 types of terrain (path/sand, grass, water, building, rock), represented by different colors: no complex graphics
  - Have a playable game with base functionality
    - Working Pokemon (levels, moves, types)
    - Working Pokemon battles (turns, damage, switching pokemon, victory/defeat)
    - Working character movement and terrain interaction
    - Working NPC interactions
    - Working building entry and exit
    - Working save functionality
